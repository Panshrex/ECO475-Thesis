    abstract = {This paper presents evidence that gasoline prices have a larger effect on demand for electric vehicles (EVs) than electricity prices in California. We match a spatially-disaggregated panel dataset of monthly EV registration records to detailed records of gasoline and electricity prices in California from 2014-2017, and use these to estimate the effect of energy prices on EV demand. Two distinct empirical approaches (panel fixed-effects and a utility-border discontinuity) yield remarkably similar results: a given change in gasoline prices has roughly four to six times the effect on EV demand as a similar percentage change in electricity prices. We explore the implications for optimal EV subsidies, which promote externality reduction benefits and correct for consumer misoptimization stemming from the undervaluation of future electricity costs.},

 abstract = {Little is known about electric vehicle (EV) demand by low- and middle-income households. In this paper, we exploit a policy that provides exogenous variation in large EV subsidies targeted at the mass market in California. Using transaction-level data, we estimate three important policy parameters: the rate of subsidy pass-through, the impact of the subsidy on EV adoption, and the elasticity of demand for EVs among low- and middle-income households. Demand for EVs in our sample is price-elastic (-3.3) and pass-through to buyers is indistinguishable from 100 percent. We use these estimates to calculate that the expected subsidy bill required for California to reach its goal of 1.5 million EVs by 2025 is likely to exceed \$12-18 billion.},

 abstract = {This paper identifies and quantifies major determinants of future electric vehicle (EV) demand in order to inform widely-held aspirations for market growth. Our model compares three channels that will affect EV market share in the United States from 2020-2035: intrinsic (no-subsidy) EV demand growth, net-of-subsidy EV cost declines (e.g. batteries), and government subsidies. Geographic variation in preferences for sedans and light trucks highlights the importance of viable EV alternatives to conventional light trucks; belief in climate change is highly correlated with EV adoption patterns; and the first \$500 billion in cumulative nationwide EV subsidies is associated with a 7-10 percent increase in EV market share in 2035, an effect that diminishes as subsidies increase. The rate of intrinsic demand growth dwarfs the impact of demand-side subsidies and battery cost declines, highlighting the importance of non-monetary factors (e.g. charging infrastructure, product quality and/or cultural acceptance) on EV demand.},

abstract = {State-level policy support for electric vehicles (EVs) increased from 2010 to 2015. A total of 27 U.S. states enacted a variety of subsidies to promote EV adoption and use. From 2015, however, many states repealed their policies and others levied annual EV fees. There is a lack of coherence in state approaches to EV policy, most exemplified by states that both subsidize EV purchases and charge them annual fees. Using panel data on EV purchase subsidies, home charger subsidies, and annual EV fees from 2010 to 2018, we estimate whether changes in economic, environmental, demographic, political, and ideological factors explain variation in state EV policies. We find that environmental ideology and state politics are the main factors supporting state EV subsidies. Economic and environmental pollution factors only played an important role in enactment of annual EV fees, as states with higher unemployment, lower reliance on the gas tax, and better air quality are less likely to impose annual EV fees.}

abstract = {Electric vehicle (EV) acceptance varies across political ideologies. EV symbolic attributes, or the extent to which people perceive EVs to reinforce aspects of their identities, are among the strongest predictors of EV adoption intentions, and may contribute to this group difference. The primary objectives of this study are to better understand the role of social (in this case, political) identity in symbolic attribute perceptions, and how these variables work together to influence EV adoption intentions. Among 545 survey respondents from the state of Ohio in the United States, Democrats are more willing to adopt EVs than Republicans. This relationship is mediated by symbolic attribute perceptions. Specifically, Democrats have stronger EV symbolic attribute perceptions than Republicans, and these perceptions predict adoption intentions. Using an identity framework, this study advances our understanding of the psychological mechanisms that help explain differences in EV adoption intent amongst U.S. Democrats vs. Republicans, and offers guidance for targeted marketing efforts to enhance EV uptake.}
